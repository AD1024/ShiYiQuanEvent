#FloatingActionMenu
---
This is a fork from https://github.com/TristanWiley/FloatingActionMenu, I modified it to support both  circle and line menu.

Check the example for usage, the default is a line. A "circle" can be used by doing

#Usage

Put the following dependency in Gradle:

    compile 'com.novaapps:FloatingActionMenu:1.0'

Check the sample for more information, to make the FloatingActionMenu a circle use the below code.
```java
    menu.setIsCircle(true)
```

The original code is from douo in this gist- gist.github.com/douo/dfde289778a9b3b6918f

I modified the code so it looks better, there's spacing between the buttons.
